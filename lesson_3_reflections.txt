When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When I want more people to collaborate with me and when I can access my files form any computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Manually I can deside when to pull but autometicaly pulling can cause errors in codes.
