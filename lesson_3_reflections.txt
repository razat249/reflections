When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   
	When I want more people to collaborate with me and when I can access my files form any
	computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    
	Manually I can deside when to pull but autometicaly pulling can cause errors in codes.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead
of another?

	Forks are clones on the github server itself clones are copying the repo localy or 
	remotely and branches are used on the same same machine.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	We can get our code if needed.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would 
be harder?

	Manually i.e. sending my code via email or othe servises. It will be harder then collaborating 
	using github.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What 
benefits does each approach have?

	When making changes in saperate branch we can experiment with the original code.
